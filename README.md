# Chessical: The JavaScript-powered Chess Engine

Welcome to **Chessical**, a unique chess engine built entirely using pure JavaScript! This project showcases a simplified yet powerful implementation of a chess engine using the Minimax algorithm with Alpha-Beta Pruning, allowing for intelligent gameplay and move suggestions.

## Key Features

- **Play as White or Black**: Experience unlimited gameplay from either side.
- **Best Move Suggestion**: Utilize the "Suggest Best Move" button to get assistance on the next optimal move. *Note*: Currently set at a search depth of 1 for speed, leading to basic move suggestions.
- **Evaluation Bar**: Visualize who has the upper hand in the game with a real-time evaluation bar.
- **Dark Mode**: Play in a visually appealing dark mode for an immersive experience.

## How It Works

Chessical leverages the **Minimax algorithm** with **Alpha-Beta Pruning** for decision-making, ensuring the engine evaluates moves efficiently by pruning unnecessary branches. However, to maintain speed, the depth of move evaluation is kept minimal for now. This means moves suggested may be naive but demonstrate the core algorithm's function.

## Why Chessical?

Unlike standard online chess games, Chessical is designed to demonstrate the underlying mechanics of a chess engine, giving users insights into move evaluation and algorithmic strategies.

## Planned Enhancements

- Increase the depth of the Minimax algorithm for stronger move suggestions.
- Add performance optimizations for faster computation.
- Improve the evaluation function for more nuanced gameplay.

## Demo & Usage

Simply open the project in your browser and start playing! Click on the "Suggest Best Move" button to get a hint, and keep an eye on the evaluation bar to gauge your standing.

## Technologies Used

- **JavaScript**: The entire engine is powered by vanilla JavaScript.
- **Minimax Algorithm**: For move evaluation.
- **Alpha-Beta Pruning**: To optimize the decision-making process.
